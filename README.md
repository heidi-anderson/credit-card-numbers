# credit-card-numbers
This is the first take-home programming exam in CSC 115 - Test Driven Development. 

This program has a few different functions. The first function assigns the type of card (American Express, Discover, Mastercard, Visa or Unknown). There are different functions to determine each type of card. 

There are more functions used for error checking, such as one that determines that the card number is only digits and another that verifies the card's length.
